              <h3>CMB B-mode Analysis</h3>
							<p>
                Generic inflationary models predict the existence of a background of primordial 
                gravitational waves which would leave an imprint "B-mode" polarization in CMB.
                One of my important works is to analyze the CMB B-mode data from the BICEP/<i>Keck</i> 
                telescopes and transform them into constraints on inflation models. These telescopes scanning 
                over a sky patch of ~600 square degrees yield multiple-frequency data which can 1) target on 
                the degree-scale inflationary B-modes at the recombination bump; and 2) account for the 
                contribution of polarization foreground from Galactic thermal dust emission and Galactic 
                synchrotron emission, since their spectral behaviors are different from that of CMB. 
              </p>

              <p>
                In particular, we use the BICEP2, <i>Keck Array</i> and BICEP3 95/150/220 GHz data up to 
                the 2018 observing season to make polarization maps, compute B-mode power spectra and conduct the 
                multi-component multi-spectral likelihood analysis. This 
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00483">"BK18" analysis</a> delivers unprecedented 
                discrimination power on inflation models. As shown in the accompanying figure, two once-popular 
                classes of inflation models (with <font color="purple">cosine law</font> and <font color="#FF8C00">
                monomial power law</font> potential) are now strongly disfavored by the observation.

              <h3>Telescope Mount</h3>
							<p>
                The BICEP/<i>Keck</i> collaboration has been developing a larger telescope BICEP Array to replace the 
                <i>Keck Array</i> telescope for a tighter constraint on inflation models. BICEP Array (BA) will have four 
                BICEP3-style receivers to host more detectors, and will expand the frequency coverage to 30/40/95/150/220/270 
                GHz to constrain the synchrotron and dust foreground dominating at two extremes of the microwave spectrum.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our research group at the University of Minnesota is responsible for making a new telescope mount that can 
                bear the weight of all new receivers and conduct scanning motion. I have worked with my colleagues on 
                the assembly, electrical and mechanical tests of this telescope mount. The video recordsa partially assembled 
                BA mount scanning at the Physics department's high bay, with a pulse-tube cooled BA receiver inside. It was 
                subsequently disassembled and shipped to the South Pole.

              <h3>Telescope Deployment</h3>
							<p>
                Another important part of my research is to install these telescopes at their exotic observation site. In the austral 
                summer of 2019, the BA1 30/40 GHz receiver and the BA mount were deployed to the Amundsen-Scott South Pole station 
                to exploit the exceptionally stable and transparent atmosphere for microwave frequency observation. I also traveled 
                and stayed there for the entire austral summer to demolish the <i>Keck Array</i> mount, install the BA mount, 
                assemble the BA1 receiver and perform full system integration.
              </p>

              <p>
                The attached photo displays the completely enclosed BA mount with BA1 receiver as well as three adapted <i>Keck</i> 
                receivers at the end of the season. We then generated the first light BA1 maps by using merely 12 hours of data.  
                This <a href="figs/BA_40GHz.png">first light image</a> shows faint but characteristic CMB temperature anisotropies 
                in the BICEP/<i>Keck</i> sky patch, demonstrating that BA became fully functional.  More information for this deployment 
                campaign is available in the <a href="https://biceparray.wordpress.com/blog/">BICEP Array construction blog</a>.
