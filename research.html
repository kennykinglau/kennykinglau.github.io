              <h3>CMB B-mode Analysis</h3>
							<p>
                Generic inflationary models predict the existence of a background of primordial 
                gravitational waves which would imprint a distinctive &ldquo;B-mode&rdquo; polarization in the CMB.
                A major focus of my work is analyzing the CMB B-mode data from the BICEP/Keck
                telescopes to constrain inflation models. These telescopes observe a â‰ˆ 600-square-degree sky patch
                at multiple frequencies for two key goals: 1) targeting the degree-scale inflationary B-modes at the 
                recombination bump; and 2) separating the polarized foregrounds from Galactic thermal dust 
                and synchrotron emission.
              </p>

              <p>
                In particular, we use data from BICEP2, Keck Array and BICEP3 at 95/150/220 GHz up to 
                the 2018 observing season to produce polarization maps, compute B-mode power spectra and perform a 
                multi-component multi-spectral likelihood analysis. This 
                <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00483">&ldquo;BK18&rdquo; analysis</a> delivers unprecedented 
                discrimination power among inflation models. As shown in the accompanying figure, two previously popular 
                classes of inflation models (with a <font color="purple">cosine-law</font> and a <font color="#FF8C00">
                monomial power-law</font> potential) are now strongly disfavored by the data.

              <h3>Telescope Mount</h3>
							<p>
                The BICEP/Keck collaboration is building BICEP Array (BA) to replace the Keck Array telescope and achieve 
                tighter constraints on inflation models. BA will consist of four BICEP3-style receivers, significantly increasing 
                detector count and extending frequency coverage to 30/40/95/150/220/270 GHz. The broader coverage enables improved
                separation of polarized foregrounds which dominate at opposite ends of the microwave spectrum.
              </p>

              <p>
                A new telescope mount has been designed to support the full weight of the upgraded receivers and to enable precise 
                scanning motion. We have worked on its mechanical assembly, electrical integration and structural testing. 
                The accompanying video shows the partially assembled BA mount undergoing scan tests in a high bay, with a cold BA 
                receiver installed. The system was later disassembled and shipped to the South Pole.

              <h3>Telescope Deployment</h3>
							<p>
                An essential part of my work involves installing these telescopes at their remote observation site. During the 
                austral summer of 2019, we deployed the BA1 30/40 GHz receiver and the newly built BA mount to the 
                Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, taking advantage of the site's exceptionally stable and transparent atmosphere 
                for microwave observations. The deployment campaign included dismantling the Keck Array mount, installing the 
                BA mount, assembling the BA1 receiver, and integrating the full system.
              </p>

              <p>
                The attached photo shows the fully enclosed BA mount with BA1 receiver alongside three adapted Keck
                receivers at the end of the season. The <a href="figs/BA_40GHz.png">first-light BA1 maps</a>, generated from just 
                12 hours of data, reveals faint but characteristic CMB temperature anisotropies in the BICEP/Keck sky patch, 
                demonstrating that the BA system was fully functional. With three years of data coadded in 2023, the 
                <a href="figs/BAprelim_40_TQU.pdf">resulting BA1 Q/U maps</a> show the first robust detection of cosmological 
                polarization at 40 GHz from the same sky patch. More details about the deployment campaign can be found on the 
                <a href="https://biceparray.wordpress.com/blog/">BICEP Array construction blog</a>.
